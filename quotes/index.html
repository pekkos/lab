    <h1>Quotes</h1>

    <p>A quote may be placed inline within a <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> element, like so: <q>Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower</q>, as Steve Jobs once said.</p>

    <blockquote>Sometimes a quote is longer and should be it's own entity. Like this.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>What if the blockquote contains another qyote? <q>Sometimes a quote is longer and should be it's own entity.</q> Like this.</blockquote>
