    <h1>Quotes</h1>

    <p>A quote may be placed inline within a <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> element, like so: <q>Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower</q>, as Steve Jobs once said i his book <cite>Be an Apple</cite>.</p>

    <blockquote>Sometimes a quote is longer and should be it's own entity. Like this.</blockquote>
    <blockquote><p>What if there is a paragraph inside? Sometimes a quote is longer and should be it's own entity. Like this.</p></blockquote>

    <blockquote>What if the blockquote contains another quote? <q>Sometimes a quote is longer and should be it's own entity.</q> Like this.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>And you know what, I read that in this fascination book called <cite>Be an Apple</cite>.</blockquote>
