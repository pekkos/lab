    <h1>
        No focusable element test
    </h1>
    <p>
        <strong>This test only works in browsers that have implemented the dialog element (and if necessary, a flag has
            been turned on to have it render)</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This test is to show what happens if a dialog element has no focusable content, but focus is set to the dialog
        itself (using "invalid" tabindex=-1 on the dialog)
    </p>


    <p>
        <button onclick="showDialog(myDialog)">
            Open my dialog!
        </button>
    </p>

    <p>
        <button onclick="showDialog(myOtherDialog)">
            Open long dialog!
        </button>
    </p>

    <dialog id="my_dialog" tabindex=-1>
        <h1>My heading</h1>
        <p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>With <strong>Firefox and Chromium browsers paired with JAWS</strong>, either the heading will be announced, or
        the focused dialog will announce as "modal dialog". Pressing down arrow will begin announcing the content of the
        dialog. The heading can be skipped over by JAWS, but that seems something JAWS should fix.
    <p>
        <strong>Narrator with Edge</strong> will announce "modal dialog" when focusing the dialog element. For the long
        dialog test, Narrator will beging reading the contents of the dialog from start to end.
    <p>
        <strong>Firefox and Chromium browsers</strong> with NVDA will start announcing the content of the dialog from
        start to finish.

    <p>
        <strong>Safari Tech Preview and VoiceOver</strong> will immediately push VO focus to the heading of the dialog,
        announcing its contents and however many other items are in the "group" (odd to not say dialog... but looking in
        Safari's dev tools Node pannel > Accessibility, the dialog presently returns "no matching ARIA role", so maybe
        that's why?)
